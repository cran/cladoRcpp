      CHANGES in cladoRcpp VERSION 0.14.2

NEW FEATURES

    o Version 0.14.2 of package cladoRcpp fixes an AddressSanitizer error found when 
      compiling under gcc48, and some notes found by Uwe Ligges's WinBuilder website, due
      unused variables, or comparison of int to unsigned int in e.g. for loops. (For
      the latter, the vector object's .size() function returns an unsigned int, so
      the forloop should start with for (unsigned int i, ...etc.)  )

      CHANGES in cladoRcpp VERSION 0.14.1

NEW FEATURES

    o Version 0.14.1 of package cladoRcpp adds to the function rcpp_states_list_to_DEmat
      (and thus C++ functions cpp_states_list_to_DEmat_COO and cpp_states_list_to_DEmat) 
      the input of "amat", a matrix of anagenetic transition probabilities for e.g. 
      instantaneous switching from A->B.  This allows cladoRcpp users to implement 
      "standard" character transition models, as used in e.g. DNA, morphology 
      characters, etc., as well as in biogeography.  Additional of this parameter allows 
      increased modeling capabilities in BioGeoBEARS.  I have also added a NEWS file.
